# Employee Concierge Demo

End-to-end multi-agent demo for [`ballerina/a2a`](https://github.com/Anuja-jayasinghe/a2a-ballerina) —
one Ballerina orchestrator routing to five independent A2A listener agents,
each in a different language/framework, exercising every operation and
transport binding the client supports.

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — the approved proposal, in full.
- [Implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md) — phased build plan, review this.
- [Naming](NAMING.md) — generic names vs. confirmed WSO2 internal names.
- [Research](docs/research/) — architectural questions settled with real evidence.

Status: Phases 1–13 complete — all five agents, the orchestrator, the
push-notification webhook receiver, local and Docker Compose bring-up,
a full functional pass with a real Anthropic key
([DEMO_SCRIPT.md](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md)), negative/chaos testing
([NEGATIVE_TEST_REPORT.md](docs/NEGATIVE_TEST_REPORT.md)), and
documentation finalization. Payroll, Parking, Travel & Expense, and the
orchestrator still carry generic names pending WSO2-internal confirmation
(see [NAMING.md](NAMING.md)) — the only open item.

## Running the whole system locally

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in a real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
./scripts/start-all.sh              # all five agents + the orchestrator
./scripts/run-structural-checks.sh  # every check that doesn't need a real key
./scripts/stop-all.sh
```

`.env` (git-ignored) is where the real Anthropic key lives — `start-all.sh`
sources it automatically. Left unset, everything still boots and every
structural check still passes —
see [the implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md)'s Phase 8
entry for what "structural" covers here. `run-structural-checks.sh` may
occasionally report the Payroll/Travel & Expense push-notification
delivery check as failed — that's the real, already-documented
a2a-java race condition from Phase 6 (see `orchestrator/README.md`), not
a bug in these scripts; re-run it and it usually passes within a few
attempts.

Running or chatting with `orchestrator/` through WSO2 Integrator: BI
instead of `bal run`? Use `./scripts/start-agents.sh` instead of
`start-all.sh` — it brings up just the five downstream agents (which the
orchestrator requires to already be reachable, no matter what starts it)
and leaves the orchestrator itself for BI to run. See
`orchestrator/README.md`'s "Chatting with it" section.

Each agent and the orchestrator also has its own README with instructions
to run and verify it individually.

## Running the whole system in Docker

Local-process (`scripts/start-all.sh`) and Docker are both fully
supported — Docker is additive, not a replacement.

```sh
./orchestrator/prepare-docker-build.sh   # ballerina/a2a isn't published to
                                          # Central; stages the local build
cp .env.example .env                     # fill in a real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d --build
./scripts/docker-verify.sh               # confirms parity with local-process
docker compose down
```

Every agent's own README, and every `verification/*` script, work
unmodified against the containerized system from the host — they hit the
same published `127.0.0.1:PORT`s either way. The one exception is
`verification/docker_parity`, which specifically has to run *inside* the
Compose network (via `scripts/docker-verify.sh`) rather than from the
host, since Compose service names like `parking` only resolve there — see
that script's own comments for why.

### A note on WSO2 Integrator: BI

The orchestrator's own architecture doc originally floated
`ballerina/ai` "(or WSO2 Integrator: BI)" as an alternative — since
confirmed as the platform this demo is actually presented through. Full
write-up, with real evidence (not guessing):
[`docs/research/wso2-integrator-bi-compatibility.md`](docs/research/wso2-integrator-bi-compatibility.md)
(is `orchestrator/` compatible? yes) and
[`docs/research/remote-agent-integration-patterns.md`](docs/research/remote-agent-integration-patterns.md)
(how should the five downstream agents be wired in? as tools — already
how `agent_tools.bal` is built).
